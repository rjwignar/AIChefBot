```bash 
$ git clone git@github.com:rjwignar/AIChefBot.git
```

Navigate to the source directory.

```bash
$ cd AIChefBot
```

Install packages using NPM (this may take a minute).
```

```

### Environment Variables

Before a working version of AIChefBot can be run in a local repository, one must acquire and set environment variables.

```touch .env```

See an example of the `.env` file [here](./.env_example)
